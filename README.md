# Project Description: TezAPI

## Overview
TezAPI ⚡️ is a high-performance API built with Hono, Next.js, and Vercel. It leverages Redis for efficient search operations, providing lightning-fast results retrieval for queries.

## Technologies Used
- **Frontend:** React (Next.js)
- **Backend:** Hono, Redis
- **Deployment:** Vercel

## Features
1. **Search Functionality:**
   - Users can search for country names using a fast autocomplete feature.
   - Results are fetched in milliseconds, enhancing user experience.

2. **User Interface:**
   - The UI is designed for simplicity and responsiveness.
   - It includes animations for a smooth user interaction.

3. **Performance Metrics:**
   - Displays the number of results found and the duration of the search query in milliseconds.
   - Performance is optimized using Redis for caching and fast retrieval.

## Technical Implementation
- **Frontend (React):**
  - Manages user input and displays search results using a Command-based UI.
  - Fetches data asynchronously from the backend API.
  - Animations and transitions enhance visual appeal and usability.

- **Backend (Hono with Redis):**
  - Handles API routes using Hono framework.
  - Utilizes Redis for storing and retrieving cached search results.
  - Implements efficient search algorithms to provide quick responses to user queries.

- **Deployment:**
  - Deployed on Vercel for scalability and reliability.
  - Uses serverless architecture (Edge runtime) to ensure minimal latency for global users.

## Usage
- Users interact with the TezAPI through the frontend interface.
- Type a country name in the search input to get autocomplete suggestions.
- Results are displayed instantly with performance metrics indicating the search duration.

## Conclusion
TezAPI demonstrates the integration of modern frontend technologies with a robust backend infrastructure to deliver a high-speed, responsive API service. It leverages the power of Redis for caching and Hono for efficient API handling, making it suitable for real-time applications requiring fast data retrieval and minimal latency.
